# Administrate

**THIS PLUGIN IS DOESN’T DO MUCH YET. DON’T EXPECT TO FIND ANYTHING USABLE.**

This repo only contains the development files.

To install it, clone it into your `plugins` folder:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/avryl/administrate`.

If you already cloned, but not recusively, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.

Install all dependencies through `npm`:

`npm install`.

And run the build script:

`grunt build`.

If you're interesting in the development or want to edit files, run `grunt` to continuously compile the modules. It should also reload the page after any CSS/JS/PHP changes.
